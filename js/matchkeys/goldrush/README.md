# Matchkeys - goldrush2024

This implements the "Gold Rush - Colorado Alliance MARC record match key generation" (specification January 12, 2024).

## Status

Experimental. Each component of the specification is implemented.

This specification removed the component "General Media Designator (GMD)" that was utilised in the 2021 specification, but did not replace it with another component.

We use it experimentally at PALCI, not for production.

## Components

Each component of the matchkey is padded with the underscore character to fill to its field width.

The [diagram](explain-matchkey-goldrush.png) indicates the components.
